What is the difference between the continue and break statements in Python?

The continue statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only.
The break statement is used to exit the loop entirely.

Can you explain the difference between for loop and while loop?

A for loop is used to iterate over a sequence (list, tuple, string) or other iterable objects.

How would you implement a nested for loop system? Provide an example.

for i in range(5):
    for j in range(5):
        print(i, j)
